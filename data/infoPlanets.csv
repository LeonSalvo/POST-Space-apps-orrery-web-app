sun,"The Sun is the central star of the Solar System and makes up 99.86% of the system's total mass. It is a yellow dwarf, with a surface temperature of about 5,500 degrees Celsius and a core that reaches temperatures above 15 million degrees Celsius. The Sun is about 149.6 million kilometers (1 AU) from Earth, and its light takes about 8 minutes to reach us. It has a diameter of 1.39 million kilometers and is approximately 4.6 billion years old. The Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion in its core, where hydrogen turns into helium, releasing an enormous amount of energy as light and heat. The Sun is essential for life on Earth, providing the energy needed for climate, biological cycles, and photosynthesis."

moon,"The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It has a diameter of 3,474 km and orbits our planet at an average distance of 384,400 km. Composed primarily of igneous rocks rich in silicon, iron, and magnesium, its surface is marked by impact craters, basaltic plains (mare), and mountains. Throughout its geological history, the Moon has been bombarded by meteoroids, which have resulted in its characteristic scars. Thanks to its synchronous rotation, the Moon always shows the same face to the Earth, known as the near side, while the far side remained unexplored until the 20th century."
